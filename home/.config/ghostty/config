# The command to run, usually a shell. If this is not an absolute path, it'll
# be looked up in the `PATH`. If this is not set, a default will be looked up
# from your system. The rules for the default lookup are:
#
#   * `SHELL` environment variable
#
#   * `passwd` entry (user information)
#
# This can contain additional arguments to run the command with. If additional
# arguments are provided, the command will be executed using `/bin/sh -c`.
# Ghostty does not do any shell command parsing.
#
# If you're using the `ghostty` CLI there is also a shortcut to run a command
# with arguments directly: you can use the `-e` flag. For example: `ghostty -e
# fish --with --custom --args`. The `-e` flag automatically forces some
# other behaviors as well:
#
#   * `gtk-single-instance=false` - This ensures that a new instance is
#     launched and the CLI args are respected.
#
#   * `quit-after-last-window-closed=true` - This ensures that the Ghostty
#     process will exit when the command exits. Additionally, the
#     `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay` is unset.

# The following command checks if tmux is installed.
# If tmux is installed, it automatically attaches to an existing tmux session.
# If no tmux session exists, a new one is created.
# If tmux is not installed, it simply starts zsh without tmux.
#
# For this to work properly, you need to make sure that your shell is configured
# for homebrew, so you should have this line:
# eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
# In your ~/.zprofile file
# If you don't have that line, or if the file doesn't exist, run this:
# echo '' >>~/.zprofile && echo '# Configure shell for brew' >>~/.zprofile && echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >>~/.zprofile && eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
#
# This assumes you installed tmux through brew if using macos
# command = zsh --login -c "if command -v tmux >/dev/null 2>&1; then tmux attach || tmux; else zsh; fi"

# Valid values:
#
#   * `true`
#   * `false` - windows won't have native decorations, i.e. titlebar and
#      borders. On macOS this also disables tabs and tab overview.
#
# The "toggle_window_decoration" keybind action can be used to create
# a keybinding to toggle this setting at runtime.
#
# Changing this configuration in your configuration and reloading will
# only affect new windows. Existing windows will not be affected.
#
# macOS: To hide the titlebar without removing the native window borders
#        or rounded corners, use `macos-titlebar-style = hidden` instead.

# Toggle the "quick" terminal. The quick terminal is a terminal that
# appears on demand from a keybinding, often sliding in from a screen
# edge such as the top. This is useful for quick access to a terminal
# without having to open a new window or tab.
#
# When the quick terminal loses focus, it disappears. The terminal state
# is preserved between appearances, so you can always press the keybinding
# to bring it back up.
#
# The quick terminal has some limitations:
#
#   - It is a singleton; only one instance can exist at a time.
#   - It does not support tabs.
#   - It will not be restored when the application is restarted
#     (for systems that support window restoration).
#   - It supports fullscreen, but fullscreen will always be a non-native
#     fullscreen (macos-non-native-fullscreen = true). This only applies
#     to the quick terminal window. This is a requirement due to how
#     the quick rerminal is rendered.
#
# See the various configurations for the quick terminal in the
# configuration file to customize its behavior.
#
# `global:` - Make the keybind global. By default, keybinds only work
#  within Ghostty and under the right conditions (application focused,
#  sometimes terminal focused, etc.). If you want a keybind to work
#  globally across your system (i.e. even when Ghostty is not focused),
#  specify this prefix. This prefix implies `all:`. Note: this does not
#  work in all environments; see the additional notes below for more
#  information.

# Valid values are:
#
#   * `top` - Terminal appears at the top of the screen.
#   * `bottom` - Terminal appears at the bottom of the screen.
#   * `left` - Terminal appears at the left of the screen.
#   * `right` - Terminal appears at the right of the screen.
#   * `center` - Terminal appears at the center of the screen.
#
# Changing this configuration requires restarting Ghostty completely.

# If `true`, the *Option* key will be treated as *Alt*. This makes terminal
# sequences expecting *Alt* to work properly, but will break Unicode input
# sequences on macOS if you use them via the *Alt* key. You may set this to
# `false` to restore the macOS *Alt* key unicode sequences but this will break
# terminal sequences expecting *Alt* to work.
#
# The values `left` or `right` enable this for the left or right *Option*
# key, respectively.
#
# Note that if an *Option*-sequence doesn't produce a printable character, it
# will be treated as *Alt* regardless of this setting. (i.e. `alt+ctrl+a`).
#
# This does not work with GLFW builds.
